# watchlist.io

Hello! This program was created for users to have an interface where they can track and update the shows that they watch. This was created using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java.

Users can create multiple "watchlists". Within these "watchlists", users can add shows, where they can add specific information about the title, status (recommended, planning to watch, watching, completed), genre, any tags, and give a rating. Users can update any information about specific shows at a later time (i.e set the status to completed once they finish the show). 

Upon closing of the GUI, all data saves into a file. When the user opens the GUI again, the file is read, in turn restoring all data.
