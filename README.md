# watchlist.io

Hello! This program was created so that users can have an interface where they can track and update the shows that they watch. This was created using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java. 

Users can create multiple "watchlists". Within these "watchlists", users can add shows, where they can add specific information about the title, status (recommended, planning to watch, watching, completed), genre, any tags, and give a rating. Users can also update the information at a later time (i.e set the status to completed once they finish the show). 

Users can also sort "watchlists" based on their title. They can also sort shows based on their title, status (recommended, planning to watch, watching, completed), genre, tags, and rating. 

Upon closing of the GUI, all data saves into a file. When the user opens the GUI again, the file is read, in turn restoring all data. 

Skills Learned: how to implement layout managers (such as FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout), custom graphics classes (such as Color and Font), GUI component classes (such as Button, TextField, and Label), GUI container classes (Frame and Panel), and event listener interfaces (such as ActionListener and WindowListener)
